# Cryptocurrency dynamic control model using power BI
In this project we have a dataset that contains some columns with some data representation. 
With the help of this data, we developed the dynamic control model using power BI and 
give the analysis visual report to the end user.
Understanding the market dynamics and performance of cryptocurrencies is essential for 
investors and traders to make informed decisions
Cryptocurrency investors and trading learners need efficient tools to analyze market trends and 
make informed decisions.
â€¢ we must develop a dynamic control model to let the investors analyze market trends efficiently.
